# Loops

Agent operation guidance for CompozyOS Loops — deterministic goal → verify → settle programs the daemon
owns and runs. Use this reference when you author, configure, run, observe, approve, or control a Loop
from inside CompozyOS. Prefer the native `compozy__loop_*` tools; fall back to `compozy loop` CLI or HTTP with
structured output. Never guess a schema — resolve `compozy__tool_info` for the exact descriptor first.

## The Tool Set And CLI Verbs

Toolset `compozy__loops` — 32 native tools. All 29 Loop tools have matching `compozy loop` verbs;
the three session-bound Goal tools use the session command/native control and report surfaces. The CLI also exposes
operator-focused `config`, `edit`, `why`, `events`, and run-scoped `nodes` reads without new native tool IDs.

When `loop why` publishes a request unblocker, execute it and enter the response JSON at the
`Response JSON:` prompt. The command uses `--payload-stdin`; it never invents an empty response for
a request whose schema may require fields or entity identifiers.

There is **no `compozy__loop_edit` native tool**. Agents edit a definition through the authoring loop
(validate → dry-run → `compozy__loop_create` with `expected_version`) or by a filesystem write. The CLI
`compozy loop edit` is a `$EDITOR` convenience for operators and publishes through the same
compare-and-swap path.

## Catalog Reads

Use `compozy loop list --workspace <ref> -o json`, HTTP/UDS `GET /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/loops`, or native `compozy__loop_list`. Filters are name/contract-goal search (`--query` in CLI, `q` elsewhere), `kind` (`read_only` or `workspace`), exact category, exact latest-run status, name sort, cursor, and limit.

The response is `loops`, exact self-filtered `facets` (`kinds`, `categories`, `statuses`), and counted `page` (`total`, normalized `limit`, `has_more`, `next_cursor`). Self-filtered means each facet omits its own active filter while respecting search and every other filter. Pages default to 50 and cap at 200.

Opaque cursors bind workspace, search, kind, category, status, and sort; limit may change. Stable order is read-only before workspace, then normalized name and ID. CompozyOS computes the cut from lean records and loads definition YAML only for selected rows. `last_run` is the all-time latest run and includes `best_generation`/`best_score` when the run has a scored best candidate; only `aggregate_30d` and `success_rate_30d` use the 30-day window.

The native/API `compozy__loop_runs` response returns `runs` plus `aggregates`; `compozy loop runs -o json`
emits an `items` array with `next_cursor` and no aggregates. Each summary includes `attention` when a
person must act and current-round `progress`; the server orders needs-you runs, then active runs, then
terminal runs. It never embeds generation history. `compozy loop runs` pages 50 rows by default; an
omitted native/API `limit` pages 100. Both cap at 500 and resume through `--cursor`/`next_cursor`, an
opaque token bound to that server order rather than a client-computed offset.

For a single run, use `compozy loop why <run> -o json` for the server-owned verdict and executable
unblocker, `compozy loop nodes --run <run> --all -o json` for the complete node-generation roster and
attempt ledger, and `compozy loop events <run> --view notable|all -o jsonl` for durable history.
`--all` and `--generation` require `--run`, and `--all` excludes `--cursor`. Roster `--state` is closed to
`all|running|queued|waiting|retrying|paused|quarantined|succeeded|failed|canceled|not_taken` and pages 50
by default up to 500; without `--run` the same verb reads the workspace exception inventory, where
`--state` is required, closed to `waiting|quarantined|attention|retrying`, and pages 50 by default up to 200.
`events --after <seq> --follow` resumes at a plain per-run sequence; HTTP timeline pagination instead
uses an opaque run-bound cursor. Follow attaches after the first page's `head_seq`, so the durable/live
handoff does not duplicate or skip events. A plain sequence beyond the current history returns the
requested position and real `head_seq` with the stable `timeline_position_beyond_head` code.

An imported snapshot carries `historical: true`. Historical rows remain visible in run reads, but the
daemon never reconciles them as live work and control verbs reject them as read-only. List aggregates
count them only in `historical`; `live`, `terminal`, `succeeded`, and `failed` describe daemon-managed
runs.

## Revisioned Loop Config

Read the snapshot with `compozy loop config --workspace <ref> --name <loop> -o json` or HTTP/UDS
`GET /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/loops/{name}/config`. The response contains nullable `config`,
resolved `effective_config`, and `config_revision`. An absent override is `config: null` at revision
`0`; reads never create a config row.

For a concurrent-safe CLI patch, pass the revision you read:

```bash
compozy loop configure --workspace <ref> --name <loop> \
  --file loop-config.yaml --expected-revision <config_revision> -o json
```

`compozy__loop_configure` accepts the same optional non-negative `expected_revision` beside `name`
and `config`; resolve its live descriptor before calling it. HTTP/UDS `PUT .../config` uses the same
field. A semantic change increments the revision by one; an unchanged patch keeps it stable. A stale
HTTP/UDS write returns `409` with `expected_revision` and `current_revision`; a native stale write is
a tool conflict. Read the current snapshot, review the intervening change, and construct a new patch
instead of replaying the stale request. Omitting the field keeps legacy unguarded patch semantics.

## Typed Inputs

The input grammar is closed to `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `file`, `agent`, `runtime`, and `ref`.
`ref.kind` is closed to `skill`, `loop`, `worktree`, `session`, `workspace`, or `secret`. An `enum`
on a string-like field takes precedence over catalog discovery. `file` is plain text: CompozyOS does
not browse or check the path.

Catalog discovery uses exact stored identifiers:

| Kind        | Native read                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `agent`     | `compozy__agent_list`           |
| `skill`     | `compozy__skill_list`           |
| `loop`      | `compozy__loop_list`            |
| `worktree`  | `compozy__worktree_list`        |
| `session`   | `compozy__session_list`         |
| `workspace` | `compozy__workspace_list`       |
| `secret`    | `compozy__vault_list`           |
| `runtime`   | `compozy__provider_models_list` |

Agent, skill, Loop, worktree, and session reads resolve the exact workspace. Workspace reads follow
the caller's workspace-access policy. Vault reads are global and return reference metadata only.
Runtime accepts a partial `{provider, model, reasoning, speed}` object; `speed` is `normal|fast`, and
exact custom model IDs remain valid. For CLI input, `provider/model@reasoning:speed=normal|fast` is
the compact form, `-` leaves provider or model unset, and `-/-:speed=fast` is speed-only intent.

Values resolve per field as run > workspace config > global config > definition default. Validation
runs after resolution for normal starts, dry runs, automation starts, fork/amend reuse, and annotated
human responses. Failures return `input_validation` with
`{loop, field, kind?, value?, origin, reason}` and create no run or side effect. In a human TTY,
`compozy loop run` prompts only for supported required values still missing after defaults;
`--no-prompt`, structured output, and non-interactive input fail without prompting.

## Human Requests

An `ask` control parks one node cell until a valid answer arrives. Use `compozy__loop_requests` to
find work, `compozy__loop_request` to read the full redacted context and expected shape, then
`compozy__loop_respond` with `payload` and the exact `run_id`, `generation`, `node_id`, and
`item_index`. `compozy__loop_request` requires the same identity. Agent
answers require `responders.agents: allow` on that node plus `loops.respond`; humans remain allowed
by default. A run starter and every agent in its durable spawn chain are always denied from
answering their own run. Treat `request_already_answered` as durable winner truth; expired and
canceled requests return `request_expired` or `request_canceled` and cannot be reopened.

Action nodes may declare `review` with an allowlist of `approve`, `edit`, `reject`, and `respond`.
The coordinator opens the request before it creates a task run. `approve` admits the exact frozen
parameters, `edit` admits a schema-valid replacement, `reject` follows the declared forward route
or fails with `quality_rejection`, and `respond` supplies a schema-valid result without execution.
Use `decision` with `compozy__loop_respond`; `edit` and `respond` require `payload`.

Node pause, resume, cancel, and kill accept `item_index` to address one fan-out cell. Use
`compozy__loop_node_amend` only for a settled output while its run, node, or cell is parked. It
appends provenance without changing the recorded output. Effective reads use the newest amendment,
and run status exposes bounded, redacted `amendments`; private output refs have no read tool.

## Run History And Best State

Use `compozy loop status` / `compozy__loop_status` for detail. The run carries its current
`generation` plus optional `best_generation`/`best_score`; `generations[]` carries durable
`parent_generation`, `origin`, `verdicts[]`, and outputs. Origins are `initial`, `stop_when`,
`reattempt`, `gate_revise`, `gate_next_generation`, `dod_retry`, `ratchet_restore`, `requeue`,
`operator_rerun`, `fork_seed`, and `nested_recovery`. Each verdict
has `gate_id`, machine `outcome`, optional `score`, and optional `route_cause_rank`. The list surfaces
remain summaries; use status when an agent needs the lineage or gate decisions.

Best fields are absent until an approved finite metric score establishes a baseline. A
`ratchet_restore` generation may point `parent_generation` at an older best while `previous.*`
still describes generation `N-1`. On `exhausted` or `stalled`, inspect `best_generation` rather than
assuming the last generation is the best candidate.

Use `compozy__loop_diff` for an ungated workspace read. `compozy__loop_rerun` opens a same-run
`operator_rerun` generation from a settled node and its dependents. `compozy__loop_fork` creates a linked
run whose settled generation 1 is `fork_seed` and whose full body first executes in generation 2. Rerun
and fork require `loops.timetravel`; an agent cannot apply either operation to its own executing run.
Pass `request_id` for replay-safe transport retries. The same key with different arguments returns
`timetravel_key_reuse`; omitting it creates a fresh operation.

Use `compozy__loop_recover_nested` when a terminal parent is still bound to a terminal failed direct
child from an awaited `run-loop` cell. Supply only the parent `run_id`, required `request_id`, and a
closed exact `runtime` (`provider` + `model`, with optional `reasoning`/`speed`). The daemon derives the
child, failed item, task ID, generations, budgets, and stored configuration. It reuses both run IDs,
carries successful siblings, applies the runtime only to the selected child generation cell, and records
`recovery` provenance. Status for either run returns the same ordered `nested_recoveries` evidence.
Replay is mandatory-key safe; lineage races, pause/cancel state, or exhausted original budgets return a
conflict without mutation.
Set the owning Loops' stored `reattempt_strategy` to the explicit `halt` value when recovery needs a
naturally settled failed lineage. `halt` ends the failed generation without quarantine or an automatic
successor; the default remains `failed_only`, and `full_body` keeps its existing behavior.

## The Authoring Loop

Follow **inspect → validate → dry-run → publish (with `expected_version`) → run**. Every step before
`run` is structured and spends no tokens.

1. **inspect** — `compozy__loop_inspect` returns the definition and its current `version`. Read the
   version before you change anything.
2. **validate** — `compozy__loop_validate` lints and compiles a candidate without saving; it returns
   per-node codes (`unknown_reference`, `node_id_invalid`, `verdict_policy_requires_judge`,
   `fan_out_unbounded`).
3. **dry-run** — `compozy__loop_run` with `dry: true` resolves inputs and returns the first generation's
   plan without creating a run or spending budget. It returns the authored `contract` beside the
   input-resolved `materialized_contract` that Goal agents and judges receive. It also builds and
   reloads the executed-definition snapshot used by submission; a template or condition manifest
   mismatch reports the exact key and source before any run is created.
4. **publish** — `compozy__loop_create` with `expected_version` set to the version from step one (or
   HTTP `PATCH /loops/:name`). This is compare-and-swap: a stale version is rejected `409` with the
   current version. Native: `tool_conflict`/`loop_version_conflict` with
   `partial_result.structured.version_conflict.current_version`; re-inspect before retrying. Use PATCH/create-with-version
   for **all** programmatic editing — the filesystem write path is last-write-wins and unsafe for
   concurrent agents.
5. **run** — `compozy__loop_run`. Only now does the Loop spend tokens.

New Loops start as a fork (`compozy__loop_create` with `fork_from_name`); there is no blank-canvas
authoring. Read-only sources — including the default `spec-cycle` Loops — must be forked before you
adapt them; native mutation is `tool_denied`/`loop_source_immutable`.

Deleting a workspace-authored Loop also removes its stored config override and editor annotations.
Run records and executed-definition snapshots remain available as history. Config and annotation
reads or writes for a missing definition return not found and never create detached sidecars.

## Goal Nodes And Session Commands

A Goal is the reserved action `kind: goal`. Its `params` require `agent`, non-empty `objective`, at
least one supported `judge`, positive `max_turns`, and an `output_schema` whose `status` enum can
represent `blocked`. `on_exhausted` is `halt` (default) or `escalate`. Goal v1 judges are `command`
(`check` required), `agent-judge` (rubric/prompt required), or `extension` (tool required); `human`
is rejected.

Missing `session` compiles to `mode: continuous`. An isolated session is the other valid strategy;
the two cannot be combined. Operational retry uses `retry.max_attempts`, which counts total
pre-submission attempts including the first. `on_failure: fresh_session` requires continuous mode
and at least two attempts. It applies only when CompozyOS proves the prompt effect never started. CompozyOS
never replays a prompt after durable start; recovery continuation is a new turn.

Authenticated Web/HTTP/UDS/CLI session prompt ingress recognizes this closed grammar:

| Command                                       | Effect                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/goal <objective>`                           | Start one session-origin Goal; an existing Goal returns `goal_replace_required`.              |
| `/goal replace <expected-run-id> <objective>` | Compare-and-swap replacement; stale identity returns `goal_replace_stale` without mutation.   |
| `/goal status`                                | Return the newest visible Goal snapshot.                                                      |
| `/goal pause`                                 | Persist an actor-aware pause and settle at a safe boundary.                                   |
| `/goal resume`                                | Resume paused work or approve the active synthetic Goal gate.                                 |
| `/goal clear`                                 | Revoke live work when needed, then hide the newest projection without deleting its audit.     |
| `/goal draft <text>`                          | Run one idle-only ordinary streaming turn that proposes objective/clauses without activation. |

Internal, automation, network, extension, and synthetic prompts treat `/goal` text literally.
Draft never queues, steers, interrupts, or consumes a Goal turn; busy admission returns
`goal_draft_requires_idle`. Lowercase line-oriented `verify:` and `constraints:` clauses become the
synthetic agent-judge rubric. `verify:` text is never executed as a command.

Agents can control a Goal without composing prompt text. `compozy__goal_control` accepts one typed
`operation` (`set`, `replace`, `status`, `pause`, `resume`, or `clear`), a required target
`session_id`, and an optional `runtime` selection for `set` or `replace`. Its caller is the
authenticated agent session: the target must be that session or a descendant in the same workspace.
The daemon preserves the Goal's immutable creation identity and resolved network participation while
applying the per-run worker runtime. `session goal set|replace|status|pause|resume|clear` and
`POST /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/sessions/{session_id}/goal` expose the same typed contract over
CLI, HTTP, and UDS. Invalid runtime, stale replacement, and unauthorized lineage return stable
structured reason codes; failed bindings remain in the Goal audit instead of being hidden.

Use the current snapshot `run_id` for replacement. If `goal_replace_stale` returns a newer snapshot,
review it before constructing another command. Terminal `blocked` is not resumable; replace with the
expected current Run ID or clear it.

Goal context is `known`, `unknown`, or `pending`. `known` carries trustworthy reported usage;
`unknown` has no percentage; `pending` waits for a strictly newer report after compaction. A
session-origin Goal requires explicit approval before recovery reseeds into a new bound session.
The origin session remains the Goal owner; use the new `bound_session_id` for ordinary messages.
Pause/Resume, approval, and reseed each allocate at most one successor control epoch.

The checkpoint-local approval scopes are narrow: turn exhaustion grants
`turn-extension/turn-limit`; budget crossed after work grants `budget/settle-current` and cannot
start new work; budget crossed before work grants `budget/work-and-settle` for one candidate turn
plus closure; reseed grants `reseed/rotate-binding`; pause grants `plain-resume/reactivate`.

`compozy__goal_get` follows an active moved-binding alias and remains readable for terminal state until
clear. `compozy__goal_report` accepts `complete` or `blocked`; blocked requires evidence. It is
available to the current bound prompt for session-, catalog-, HTTP-, and native-tool-origin Runs.
Evidence is limited to 16 KiB, and the daemon revalidates workspace, Run, prompt, control, and
binding identity. It records a durable boundary intent, not immediate completion or proof of
provider-side effect uniqueness. Retry of the same intent deduplicates; conflict or revoke fails
with a stable reason.

`compozy__loop_turns` and `compozy loop turns --run <id> --after-seq <n>` read the run-wide monotonic audit;
optional node/item filters narrow one instance. `compozy loop runs --origin session
--origin-session <id>` isolates conversational Runs. Turn result, reason, stop reason, verdict,
evidence, usage, and end time remain nullable until durable evidence exists. Settled turns retain
bounded criterion diagnostics and aggregate warnings. Command criteria include outcome, exit code,
standard output, standard error, blockers, and warnings when present; continuation prompts and the
Web timeline use that durable evidence.

## Terminal Outcomes And Live States

When a Loop reaches a terminal state, CompozyOS settles its coordinator and cell task records in the
same store transaction. Use `compozy task timeline <task>` to distinguish an inline settlement
(`reason = loop_run_terminal`), a reconciliation repair (`reconciled_run_terminal`), and an
execution record whose Loop run was removed (`run_missing`).

A run holds one of twelve states. Report the terminal outcome exactly — never round an error or an
exhausted budget up to success.

**Terminal (7):**

- `done` — the goal was verified. The only success outcome.
- `no-op` — ran, found nothing to do. A clean watch tick is `no-op`, not a fake `done`.
- `blocked` — an external dependency blocked progress (missing dependency/credential/resource, a
  human-gate `reject`, or a `loop.gate.pre` denial).
- `failed` — an unrecoverable node/gate error or a `loop.generation.pre` denial.
- `canceled` — an operator cancel or kill, with cause `operator_cancel` or `operator_kill`.
- `exhausted` — the iteration cap or an authored `max_fan_out` bound tripped before the goal.
- `stalled` — no progress: the no-progress window elapsed, the failure circuit breaker tripped, the
  blocker-ID signature repeated, or a watched source went silent.

Failure streaks are evaluated per node across generations, so a healthy sibling cannot reset a
failing node's breaker. An unbounded watch run also stalls after consecutive failed generations;
healthy waiting ticks remain `watching`.

**Live (5):** `queued` (deferred start under `concurrency: queue`), `running`, `watching` (dormant
watch tick), `needs-approval` (parked on a human gate — a live pause, not terminal), `paused`
(operator paused at a boundary). `ready` and `awaiting_child` are node-level, never run states.

A `run-loop` node in `await` mode remains `awaiting_child` with its exact `child_loop_run_id` while
the child is live. The parent remains live, dependents stay pending, and daemon restart restores the
same child identity without submitting another child. Child `done` or `no-op` settles the node as
`succeeded`; every other child terminal outcome settles it as `failed`. `detach` remains immediate
success and does not establish parent wait ownership.

Native control rejections are `tool_invalid_input`: `invalid_status_transition` for an unsupported
live state, or `terminal_loop_run` after termination. `schema_invalid` is reserved for malformed input.

## Failure Contract And Node Recovery

Failure handling has fixed precedence: eligible automatic retry → authored `on_error.route` or
`allow_fail` → effects → generation-level repair or terminal policy. An unannotated failure
escalates; absorption is never implicit. The closed classes are `transport`, `payload_declared`,
`quality_rejection`, `authoring`, `cancellation`, `attempt_timeout`, `budget_exhausted`, and
`target_unavailable`. Only `transport` and `attempt_timeout` are retry-eligible.

`retry` carries `max_attempts`, optional `on_failure`, `backoff.{base,max}`, and `non_retryable`.
Mechanical actions inherit family defaults; `run-agent` and `run-loop` require explicit node retry;
`goal` does not use generic retry. `timeout` bounds one attempt and `deadline` bounds attempts plus
backoff. `result_contract` maps an application failure payload into `payload_declared`.

Effects declare exactly one `emit` or `tool` plus optional `with`. Node triggers are `on_retry`,
`on_success`, `on_pause`, `on_timeout`, `on_cancel`, and `on_quarantine`; contract triggers cover all
seven terminal outcomes. Effects observe committed state, fail open, and tool delivery is at least
once with a stable `delivery_id`. Templates can read `inputs` and
`effect.identity|failure|quarantine|attempt|links`.

Use `compozy__loop_nodes` or `compozy loop nodes --state waiting|quarantined|attention|retrying` to
find workspace-scoped cells; narrow with Loop or run ID. Then use
the exact run/node/item identity with node pause (`drain|cancel`), resume
(`plain|reset_attempts|immediate`, optional manual-wait payload), cancel, kill, or requeue. Requeue is
quarantine-only and creates a bounded successor generation. Cancel is cooperative; Kill fences
immediately. A missing managed session is already stopped for cancellation delivery. Recovery
reopens a canceled coordinator task only while its Loop remains nonterminal, then reserves one
replacement coordinator run. Run cancel/kill both end `canceled` with distinct operator causes.

Silence raises attention and never auto-kills or auto-pauses. Confirmed process/transport death may
resume from progress through the bounded death-streak authority; parked nodes are never
death-resumed. Paused nodes, durable waits, approval waits, and quarantined cells suspend node
clocks and the run wall-clock work budget; token spend still counts.

When another failure parks a Loop worker task run as `needs_attention`, use
`compozy task run recover <run-id> --reason <reason> -o json` after fixing the cause. Recovery queues
a linked child and atomically rebinds the same node cell at the next attempt and epoch while
preserving its workspace and runtime binding.

## Re-attempt And Succession Semantics

Node failure and gate rejection use different controls:

| Cause                            | Next generation                                                                   | Origin                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Node failure, `failed_only`      | Failed/pending nodes plus transitive dependents rerun; unrelated successes carry. | `reattempt`            |
| Node failure, `full_body`        | Every body node reruns.                                                           | `reattempt`            |
| Node failure, `halt`             | Settle the current generation `failed`; do not quarantine or create a successor.  | No successor           |
| In-body gate `revise`            | Producers of every route-causing gate, those gates, and dependents rerun.         | `gate_revise`          |
| Metric-gate `revise` with a best | The producer-scoped repair carries unrelated outputs from the best baseline.      | `ratchet_restore`      |
| In-body gate `next_generation`   | A fresh full-body generation starts.                                              | `gate_next_generation` |
| DoD gate `next_generation`       | A fresh full-body generation starts instead of terminating.                       | `dod_retry`            |

Both `next_generation` surfaces preserve the rejecting verdicts in `previous.verdicts.*` and their
ordered gate IDs in `previous.route_causes`. `revise` is targeted repair; `next_generation` is a
fresh pass. Bounds still apply. For evidence-sensitive work, put the acceptance rule in a typed gate
and route a weak verdict through `revise`, `next_generation`, or `halt`; do not hide the transition
inside prompt prose.

## The Approve Capability Gate

`compozy__loop_approve` requires the `loops.approve` capability, and **an agent can never approve a run
it started**. The daemon compares the approver's identity against the run's starter: an agent
session cannot approve its own run — the call is denied `ErrPermissionDenied` (reason
`approval_self_denied`). A different agent, or an operator, can approve. Provide `run_id`, `gate_id`,
and `decision` (`approve` | `request_changes` | `reject`). `approve` resumes, `request_changes`
revises into the next generation, `reject` halts on a `blocked` outcome.

Budget escalation uses the synthetic gate ID `budget`; it is not an authored node ID. It accepts
only `approve` to grant one continuation or `reject` to halt. `request_changes` is invalid for the
synthetic budget gate.

## Reference Grammar And Reserved Action Kinds

Definitions reference data over one namespace with two surfaces, chosen by the field:

- **Values** — Go `{{ }}` templates in string fields (`params.*`, rubrics, `transform.map.*`).
- **Conditions** — CEL returning `bool` (`branch.condition`, `route.routes[].when`,
  `fan-out.filter`, `contract.stop_when`).

`contract.stop_when` accepts either a CEL string or `{ expr, on_eval_error }`, where the policy is
`fail` or `exit`. A broken continuation exits by default so it cannot keep a run alive. Route
conditions fail the node and never fall through to the default. Other routing predicates on
`branch` and filtered `watch-events` nodes also fail by default; their `on_eval_error` may override
that behavior. Predicate costs at or above 80% of the configured CEL limit produce a warning;
exceeding the limit follows the same failure policy.

Contract narrative fields (`goal`, `definition_of_done`, `constraints[]`, `boundaries[]`) accept only
declared `inputs` references and materialize once before Goal work. Goal params and nested gate inputs
materialize recursively at their execution boundary; direct references retain JSON types and raw
`output_schema` values are never rendered. Literal `{{ ... }}` inside an input value stays literal —
agents and judges do not run a second template pass. Run detail exposes raw `executed_definition`
beside the input-resolved `materialized_contract`.

`command` criteria keep the exact shell program written by the Loop author. Every runtime template
value emitted inside `check` must end with `| shellQuote` and remain outside authored quotes or
escapes, comments, and `<<` constructs; compilation rejects unsafe substitutions. This preserves
authored pipes, redirects, and chaining while preventing inputs, trigger payloads, or node outputs
from introducing shell syntax.

Namespace roots: `inputs.<name>`, `nodes.<id>.output.<path>`, `nodes.<id>.status`,
`nodes.<fan-out-id>.progress.<field>`, `item`/`index` and `progress.<field>` (fan-out body only),
custom `bind_as`/`index_as` names (their fan-out body only), `trigger.<path>` (trigger/webhook starts only), `event.<path>` (`watch-events`
`events[].filter` scope only), `generation`, plus these read-only history roots:

- `previous.generation`, `previous.nodes.<id>.{status,output}`,
  `previous.verdicts.<gate_id>.{outcome,score,blocking_issues,criteria}`, and ordered
  `previous.route_causes`.
- `best.generation`, `best.score`, and `best.nodes.<id>.output`; best status and verdicts are not
  projected.

`previous` and `best` keep a total authored shape in every generation. Before either projection
exists, its `generation` is `0`, schema-known output fields use zero values, and verdict lists are
empty. Sparse repair generations keep the same shape. Structural guards such as
`{{ with .previous }}` are valid, but use `{{ if .previous.generation }}` or
`{{ if .best.generation }}` when history-dependent prose should be omitted. Node IDs match
`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` (lowercase snake_case) so the same ID is valid in templates and CEL.

Fan-out `strategy` is `wait_all` by default. `fail_fast` and `race` accept string shorthand.
`best_effort` uses object form with `threshold: "66%"` or `threshold: {count: 2}` and requires
`missing: acceptable`. Collect output is `{total,succeeded,failed,canceled,coverage_rate,partial}`;
run list/status payloads expose `completion_state` as `complete` or `partial`. Progress fields are
`total`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `canceled`, `running`, `pending`, `settled`, `success_rate`, and
`failure_rate`.

A fan-out `filter` evaluates once per source element before batching and before the `max_fan_out`
check. Its scope contains `item`, the source `index`, and that fan-out's `bind_as`/`index_as`
aliases. Only matching elements produce lanes. Evaluation errors fail closed by default;
`on_eval_error: exit` ends the Loop instead.

Node classes: `action` (open), `control` (closed), `source` (closed). Reserved **action** kinds are
`goal`, `run-agent`, `run-loop`, `transform`; every other action kind is a literal tool ID
(`compozy__*`/`ext__*`/`mcp__*`). Control kinds: `fan-out`, `collect`, `branch`, `route`, `gate`,
`wait`, `sub-loop`. A `route` evaluates ordered `{when, to}` entries, takes the first match, and
otherwise takes its mandatory `default`; every target is a unique direct forward edge. A `wait`
declares exactly one of `for`, `until`, or `event`, with optional `expect`, `ahead_arrival`, and
`expires`. Source kinds: `input`, `file-import`, `watch-source`, `watch-events`.
A fan-out requires positive `max_fan_out`; logical lanes may exceed 64, while only its
`max_parallel` window materializes at once.
A `run-agent` result is validated against its pinned `output_schema` before the owning daemon
settles the task and again before node success is published. A mismatch fails with
`invalid_output`; content-addressed storage preserves the exact structured value. The bound agent
session may call `compozy__task_run_heartbeat`, but only the owning daemon may call the terminal
complete or fail operations for that task.
Each managed `run-agent` cell owns a system session. A session-started Loop records the nearest
origin session as informational parent lineage without borrowing it. Terminal cell settlement
closes the binding and queues a durable stop. A failure scheduled for retry keeps the binding active
until the cell reaches a terminal boundary.
A gate's
`verdict_policy: revise_until_clean` requires an `agent-judge` or `human` criterion. For a command
criterion with `expect: stdout_contains`, set the typed `contains` field to the required stdout
substring.

Gate `on_result` keys are `pass`, `approval`, `fail`, `blocked`, `error`, `timeout`, and
`invalid_output`. Values are `continue`, `revise`, `next_generation`, `escalate`, `halt`, or an
in-body direct target written as `{route: node_id}`. The old `branch` action is invalid. An
`approval` outcome may only `escalate` or `halt`; an object route cannot bypass approval.

`run-agent` and `goal` accept one `params.environment` with mode `root`, `worktree`, `per_run`, or
`directory`. The node value wins over the Loop default; otherwise execution uses the workspace root.
`worktree` requires `worktree_ref`, `directory` requires a contained `directory`, and `per_run`
creates one worktree per execution instance, including each fan-out branch. `run-loop` forwards the
parent environment unless the child resolves its own default. Other node kinds reject `environment`.
The retired `params.cwd` fails validation; migrate it to
`params.environment: {mode: directory, directory: <path>}`.

### Metric Criteria

One `command`, `agent-judge`, or `extension` criterion per definition may declare
`metric: {direction: maximize|minimize, min_delta?: <finite non-negative number>}`. `human` cannot.
Unset `min_delta` means `0`, but improvement remains strict. A candidate advances
`best_generation`/`best_score` only when its finite score improves in the declared direction and
the aggregate gate verdict is approved. Missing or non-finite required scores become
`invalid_output`; rejected candidates never establish or advance best.

Score contracts are criterion-specific:

- command standard output is exactly one score-only JSON object, e.g. `{"score":0.72}`;
- the agent-judge verdict object includes numeric `score` with its verdict, evidence, and blockers;
- extension structured output includes numeric `score` with `verdict` (and may include evidence and
  blockers).

A rejected metric candidate routed through `revise` restores from an existing best; with no best it
repairs from the last generation. A distinct `next_generation` route starts a fresh full body.

Runtime routing belongs to the Loop runtime. Worker fields resolve independently in this order:
per-run rules, imported task frontmatter, a referenced runtime input, configured runtime rules,
literal `params.runtime`, `runtime_defaults.worker`, then the agent definition. A higher layer
replaces only the fields it sets. `resolved_runtime.source` uses `input` for the referenced layer.
Rules match one exact `id`, one `type`, one `complexity`, or the conjunction
`type + complexity`. The conjunction is AND. Specificity is
`id > type + complexity > type > complexity`; later equal-specificity rules
win per non-empty runtime field. Child `run-loop` definitions resolve their own rules and never
inherit the parent's per-run rules.

Use `contract.runtime_defaults` and `contract.runtime_rules` in a Loop definition, or
`[loops.defaults.delivery|watch]` plus stored Loop config for operator defaults. `run-agent` and
`goal` nodes use either literal `params.runtime` or an exact direct reference such as
`runtime: "{{ .inputs.worker_runtime }}"` to a declared `type: runtime` input. Field interpolation
inside the object is invalid. Imported task frontmatter may set
`runtime: {provider, model, reasoning, speed}`.
Judges use only `runtime_defaults.judge` plus the criterion's `runtime`; task rules never select a
judge. The retired `model_defaults`, scalar `params.model`, and scalar criterion `model` keys fail
with migration guidance.

`--runtime` is repeatable and preserves rule order:

```bash
compozy loop run \
  --workspace . \
  --name implement-tasks \
  --runtime worker=codex/gpt-5.4@high:speed=fast \
  --runtime type=frontend:claude/opus:speed=normal \
  --runtime id=task_03:-/gpt-5.5-codex@xhigh:speed=fast \
  --dry-run \
  -o json
```

The repeatable examples remain default or single-selector rules. Configure a `type + complexity`
conjunction in `runtime_rules`; this reference documents no compact CLI conjunction syntax.

The runtime expression is `provider/model@reasoning:speed=normal|fast`. Use `-` to leave provider or
model unset, `-/-:speed=fast` for speed-only intent, and bare `worker=opus` for model-only shorthand.
Gateway model IDs retain slashes after the first provider separator. Speed is provider-neutral; do
not hide fast mode inside a model ID. Dry-run resolves workspace, stored, definition, and per-run
layers without creating a run.

Declared Loop inputs may have global or workspace defaults under
`[loops.inputs.<loop-name>]`. Resolution is per key: run, workspace, global, then definition.
Dry-run reports the effective value plus `run|workspace|global|definition` origin. Manage dynamic
paths with `compozy config get|set|unset loops.inputs.<loop-name>.<key>`; HTTP and UDS expose the
same exact-scope lifecycle under `/loops/{name}/input-defaults`. Stored values are validated only
when that Loop is dry-run or submitted, and failures return typed `input_default` diagnostics.

`compozy loop validate` performs static definition validation. Dry-run and submission perform
effective validation after workspace, stored, and per-run layers resolve, then the daemon validates
again immediately before binding. Failures return structured `runtime_validation` items and spawn
no ACP process. Provider IDs must resolve; exact model IDs pass through unchanged and the ACP/provider
boundary reports a model rejection when it cannot bind that ID.

Successful generation outputs expose the binder-applied `resolved_runtime` fields, per-field
provenance, and the speed outcome (`applied`, `unsupported`, or `rejected`) through `compozy loop
status`, HTTP/UDS run detail, `compozy__loop_status`, and `runtime_applied` SSE frames. The web run
inspector displays the same durable values read-only.
Successful persisted `loop run` responses also expose `web_url`; human output prints it as the final
line. Dry-run has no run ID and never emits a URL.

## Loop Hook Events

The `loop.*` hook family has seven events; two can block. Dispatch is typed and fail-open — a broken
hook does not fail a run.

- `loop.started`, `loop.generation.post`, `loop.gate.post`, `loop.node.terminal`, `loop.terminal` —
  observe-only.
- `loop.generation.pre` — sync-eligible; a denial ends the run `failed`.
- `loop.gate.pre` — sync-eligible; a denial ends the run `blocked`.

Every payload carries the loop context (`loop_run_id`, `workspace_id`, `loop_name`, `generation`,
`node_id`, and more). Generation payloads expose `parent_generation` plus the closed `origin`
vocabulary: `initial`, `stop_when`, `reattempt`, `gate_revise`, `gate_next_generation`, `dod_retry`,
`ratchet_restore`, or `requeue`. Gate payloads expose `outcome`, optional `score`, and optional
`best_generation`. Manage hooks with `compozy__hooks_*`.

## Loop Run Event Stream

`GET /loop-runs/:run_id/events` streams durable named SSE frames for a run. Reconnect with
`Last-Event-ID` or `?after_sequence=` to resume after a sequence number. Payloads are redacted and
bounded before storage; reads are scoped to the run's workspace. The closed event vocabulary is:

- execution: `status_changed`, `generation_started`, `node_running`, `node_succeeded`, `node_failed`,
  `gate_verdict`, `runtime_applied`, `channel_msg`, `token_tick`, `needs_approval`,
  `goal_turn_started`, `goal_turn_completed`, `goal_status_changed`;
- node lifecycle: `node_retry_scheduled`, `node_paused`, `node_resumed`, `node_canceled`,
  `node_killed`, `node_quarantined`, `node_requeued`, `node_wait_started`, `node_wait_resumed`,
  `node_attention_flagged`, `node_attention_cleared`;
- observation and safety: `effect_results`, `custom_event`, `duplicate_suppressed`,
  `target_breaker_transition`, `stale_schedule_dropped`, `late_arrival`, `predicate_diagnostic`.

`generation_started` carries `generation`, `parent_generation`, `origin`, `reattempt_strategy`, and
`loop_name`. `gate_verdict` carries the sanitized `node_id`, `generation`, `gate_id`, `item_index`,
`verdict`, `reason`, `route`, `blocking_issues`, `criteria`, optional `score`, and optional
`best_generation`. `predicate_diagnostic` identifies the predicate and includes the diagnostic code,
reason, measured cost, configured cost limit, and warning flag. `goal_turn_completed` carries the
settled Goal result plus bounded `criteria` and `warnings`, matching persisted turn reads. The retired
`confidence` field is not part of either payload.

## Watch-Source Behavior

A Loop with a `watch-source` node is a watch Loop. It holds `watching` between ticks, defaults to
`iteration_cap: 0` (`∞`, never `exhausted`), ends a clean tick `no-op`, and ends on silence past its
window `stalled` (reason `watch_source_silence`). Watch sources are extension-defined; the bundled
`spec-cycle` extension does not publish one. Every `watch/poll` response must carry a stable
`event_key`; missing, invalid UTF-8, or values over 256 bytes fail before admission, with no fallback.

## Orchestrated Task Delivery

The bundled `orchestrate-tasks` Loop delivers an authored spec by delegation instead of fan-out.
Start it with `compozy loop run --workspace <workspace-id> --name orchestrate-tasks --input slug=<slug>`.
The optional `orchestrator` input selects the conducting agent and defaults to `general`.

Its single Goal node runs that agent continuously and instructs it to follow the `cy-orchestrate-tasks`
skill: one `compozy spawn` worker session per task, in graph order, each dispatched with a blocking
`compozy session prompt` and stopped with `compozy session stop` on every path out. The Loop pins no
provider or model — workers inherit the runtime resolved for the agent they are spawned with, and
operators own delivery-wide pinning through `[loops.defaults.delivery.runtime_defaults]`.

A `type: command` judge runs from the workspace root and passes only when every
`.compozy/tasks/<slug>/task_*.md` carries `status: completed`. The orchestrator's report never closes
the Goal; the task files do. Use `implement-tasks` instead when the Loop itself should fan out over
the same task files.

## Agent-Authored Review and Fix

The bundled `review-and-fix` Loop reviews a named task without a pull-request provider. Start it with
`compozy loop run --workspace <workspace-id> --name review-and-fix --input task_name=<task>`.
Optional `reviewer` and `fixer` inputs select agents; `auto_commit` defaults to `false`.

The reviewer returns source-agnostic structured issues. `ext__spec_cycle__write_review_artifacts`
creates the next exclusive `.compozy/tasks/<task>/reviews-NNN/` round inside the authenticated
workspace, validates file containment, and returns complete batches of issue-file paths. The fixer
reads each batch and changes `status: pending` only to `valid` or `invalid`; it never creates,
renames, timestamps, or resolves an issue file. `ext__spec_cycle__finalize_review_round` alone changes
triaged statuses to `resolved` and returns structured `{resolved, invalid, pending}` counts. The next
generation reviews the task again; an empty `issues` array ends the run. Neither artifact tool input
accepts a workspace root.

Scheduled watch Loops default to `catch_up_policy: coalesce`; other scheduled Loops default to
`skip_missed`. Explicit recurring schedule policies are `skip_missed`, `coalesce`, `replay`, and
`run_once_on_catchup`. Catch-up starts carry
structured metadata (`scheduled_at`, `original_due_at`, `catch_up`, `catch_up_policy`) on the
automation run.

## Watch-Events Behavior

A `watch-events` source node makes a Loop react to an **internal CompozyOS event** (unlike `watch-source`,
which polls an external signal through an extension). The node carries a typed `events` list; each
subscription is `{ kind, filter }` where `kind` is a supported hook-event name and `filter` is an
optional CEL condition over `event`, `inputs`, and `nodes`. Multiple subscriptions OR together; an
empty filter matches every event of that kind in the workspace. Hook dispatch is only the doorbell —
the matched batch is re-derived from the durable ledger at wake, so subscriptions survive daemon
downtime and dropped hooks. `event.seq` is the durable, monotonic replay position within its ledger
stream. For loop events, it is shared across runs and is separate from the per-run SSE sequence on
`GET /loop-runs/:run_id/events`. The batch lands at `nodes.<id>.output`.

Supported kinds are validated at publish against the family registry; an unsupported kind fails lint
(`watch_events_kind_unsupported`, which names the supported set). Only post-state observation hooks
are subscribable — sync-eligible `pre_*` hooks are rejected. Supported families are:
`task.status_changed`, `task.blocked`, `task.unblocked`, `task.needs_attention`, `task.recovered`
(`task_events`); `task.run.completed`, `task.run.failed` (`task_events`); `loop.terminal`,
`loop.node.terminal` (`loop_run_events`); `automation.run.completed`, `automation.run.failed`

`network.message.persisted`, `network.thread.opened`,
`network.direct_room.opened`, `network.work.opened`, `network.work.transitioned`,
`network.work.closed` (`network_timeline_log`); `coordinator.spawned`, `coordinator.decision`,
`coordinator.stopped`, `coordinator.failed` (`event_summaries`); `event.post_record`
(`session_events:<session_id>`). `event.post_record` must constrain `event.session_id` with equality
or lint returns `watch_events_filter_too_broad`; its output excludes record content and exposes only
metadata such as `record_type`, `sequence`, `turn_id`, `agent_name`, and `session_id`.

A Loop with a `watch-events` node holds `watching` between wakes and **never stalls on silence** — a
quiet subscription is healthy dormancy. It keeps the delivery default `iteration_cap: 50` unless the
definition sets `0`; only `watch-source` selects the unbounded watch default. The
parked read-model (active subscriptions, per-stream cursors, `last_wake_at`) is exposed on the run
detail (`compozy loop status --run-id <id> -o json`, HTTP/UDS parity) only while the Loop is dormant
on events.

## Harvesting A Channel Decision

To let agents converse and act on the result, post with a `compozy__network_send` action carrying a
`harvest: { kind: channel_result, window, responder?, content_rule? }`. The retired `channel-post`
kind does not exist. After the send, the node waits `window` for the designated result — a `say`
with `intent: result` or a `trace` with `state: completed` — and exposes it as
`nodes.<id>.output.*`. Silence past `window` ends the run `stalled`. `content_rule` narrows the
match: `any`, `json`, `non_empty`, `contains:<needle>`, or `json_path:<a.b.c>`. This capability is a
documented example, not a packaged default Loop.
