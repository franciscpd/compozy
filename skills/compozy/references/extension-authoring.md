# Extension Authoring

Write a CompozyOS extension. Lifecycle mechanics — generation handles, instance scoping, dev overlays,
reload semantics, logs, install trust, publish credentials — live in
`references/extensions.md`. Native tool IDs and risk flags live in
`references/native-tools.md`. Read this file for what goes in the code.

## Code-First Model

The SDK declaration is the single source of truth. `compozy extension build` starts the built binary
with the `__describe` argument, reads the contract it prints, and generates
`dist/gen-<hash>/extension.toml`. Never hand-write or hand-edit a manifest for a subprocess
extension: the next build overwrites it. Hand-written manifests are for resource-only extensions,
which run no extension process. When a native resource-only manifest declares at least one skill,
agent, Loop, automation, or layout path, `build` validates and copies those resources without running
build or describe commands. Executable extension contracts — including hooks, tools, MCP servers,
bridge metadata, and command groups — still require `package.json` or `go.mod`.

There is no second place to declare identity, schemas, permissions, tools, hooks, or commands, so
schema-digest drift cannot occur. Manifest generation is deterministic; identical source produces a
byte-identical manifest.

Published SDKs, both version-matched to the daemon: `@compozy/extension-sdk` on npm and
`github.com/compozy/compozy/sdk/go`. `build` stamps `min_compozy_version` from the SDK, so an
extension cannot claim compatibility its SDK does not have.

## Templates

`compozy extension init <name> --template <template> [--dir <path>]` writes source plus
`package.json` or `go.mod` and nothing else.

| Template                   | Use for                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `tool-provider-ts`         | Agent-callable tools in TypeScript (default).  |
| `tool-provider-go`         | Agent-callable tools in Go.                    |
| `view-provider-ts`         | A programmable palette view with React.        |
| `memory-backend-ts`        | The `memory.backend` provide surface.          |
| `loop-watch-source-go`     | The `loop.watch_source` provide surface.       |
| `connectivity-provider-go` | A Gateway connectivity provider in Go.         |
| `connectivity-provider-ts` | A Gateway connectivity provider in TypeScript. |

## Declaration Shape

Go:

```go
extension := compozysdk.NewExtension(compozysdk.ExtensionDefinition{
	Name: "hello", Version: "0.1.0", Description: "…",
	Subprocess:  compozysdk.DescribeSubprocess{Command: "./bin"},
	Permissions: compozysdk.PermissionsConfig{Requires: []compozysdk.HostAPIMethod{"sessions/list"}},
})
compozysdk.Tool[searchInput](extension, "search", compozysdk.ToolOptions{
	Description: "…", ReadOnly: true, InputSchema: searchInputSchema,
}, handleSearch)
extension.Run(context.Background())
```

TypeScript uses `new Extension({...})`, `extension.tool<TInput>(name, options, handler)`, and
`extension.start()`. Hook resources run through their declared one-shot subprocess executor; the
persistent extension protocol has no hook-execution method.

Registering a tool adds `tool.provider` to `capabilities.provides` automatically; do not declare it.
The handler name plus the extension name produce the tool ID `ext__<extension>__<tool>`: each segment
lowercased, `[a-z0-9]` kept, every other run of characters collapsed to a single `_`, and `__`
reserved as the separator.

`InputSchema` is a JSON Schema object. Provide `OutputSchema` only when the tool has one; the digest
of each is computed by the SDK and re-verified by the daemon.

Registration closes at `initialize`. Register every tool, hook, watch source, and command group
before `Run`/`start`.

## Scoped Required Hooks

Declare a synchronous required `tool.pre_call` hook in the same extension definition as its fixed
subprocess. Go:

```go
extension := compozysdk.NewExtension(compozysdk.ExtensionDefinition{
	Name:    "batuta-hooks",
	Version: "0.1.0",
	Subprocess: compozysdk.DescribeSubprocess{
		Command: "./bin/batuta-hooks",
		Args:    []string{"serve", "--stdio"},
		Env:     map[string]string{"BATUTA_MODE": "delivery"},
	},
	SupportedHookEvents: []compozysdk.DescribeHookEvent{{
		Name:     "batuta-publisher-tool-guard",
		Event:    contracts.HookEventToolPreCall,
		Mode:     contracts.HookMode("sync"),
		Matcher:  contracts.HookMatcher{AgentName: "batuta-publisher"},
		Required: true,
	}},
})
```

TypeScript:

```ts
const extension = new Extension({
  name: "batuta-hooks",
  version: "0.1.0",
  subprocess: {
    command: "./bin/batuta-hooks",
    args: ["serve", "--stdio"],
    env: { BATUTA_MODE: "delivery" },
  },
  supported_hook_events: [
    {
      name: "batuta-publisher-tool-guard",
      event: "tool.pre_call",
      mode: "sync",
      matcher: { agent_name: "batuta-publisher" },
      required: true,
    },
  ],
});
```

`build` trims represented strings, deep-copies matcher state, sorts declarations by profile, event,
and name, and removes only identical complete duplicates. The initialize handshake independently
advertises each event name once. The legacy event-only form remains valid:

```go
SupportedHookEvents: []compozysdk.DescribeHookEvent{{Event: contracts.HookEventToolPreCall}}
```

```ts
supported_hook_events: [{ event: "tool.pre_call" }];
```

For an event-only declaration, `build` derives the name by replacing event dots with hyphens, uses
sync mode when the event is sync-eligible and async mode otherwise, leaves the matcher empty, and
sets `required` to false. Exact empty `name` and `mode` values have the same semantics as omission;
a detectable non-empty whitespace-only value is invalid instead of being defaulted.

Build validation rejects an unknown event, an unsupported event/mode or event/matcher combination,
`required: true` unless the effective mode is sync, and duplicate normalized `(profile, name)`
identities. Matcher data is lossless only for fields represented by the extension manifest. A
nonzero `worktree_id`, `sandbox_id`, `sandbox_backend`, `sandbox_profile`, `sync_direction`,
`participation_mode`, `participation_source`, or `autonomy` matcher is rejected rather than dropped.

Every generated hook reuses the extension subprocess `command`, `args`, and `env` exactly. A
code-first hook cannot select a hook-specific command, executor kind, or persistent SDK method; the
persistent extension protocol has no generic hook-handler service. The fixed command must recognize
the one-shot hook payload mode as well as any persistent extension mode it serves.

Required synchronous hooks fail closed at the real tool boundary. `tools.RuntimeRegistry` runs
`tool.pre_call` admission before the protected handler; a matched required error, timeout, malformed
response, unavailable subprocess, or explicit denial prevents the handler from running. A
non-matching call proceeds normally. Agent identity, tool read-only state, and workspace root used by
matchers come from trusted runtime owners, not tool input.

## Ready Callback Lifecycle

Go `OnReady` callbacks start after initialization. Register them before `Run`, treat `ctx.Done()` as
the stop signal, and return promptly. On shutdown, the SDK cancels accepted callbacks and takes one
bounded drain snapshot at the request deadline or negotiated runtime timeout. Observable completion
wins when completion and deadline are both ready; `Run` reports non-cancellation failures captured
by that snapshot, while failures recorded after a deadline decision are excluded. A callback that
outlives that decision may outlive `Run`. Registrations after shutdown or runtime closure are ignored.

## Permissions And Consent

`permissions.requires` is the single authored list: the Host API method paths the extension calls,
validated against the closed Host API method set at build, validate, install, and load. An unknown value is a
hard error, never a silent no-op. Both SDKs export the method names as typed constants.

CompozyOS derives operator-facing consent areas (`area:access`, such as `sessions:read` or
`memory:write`) from that list. Consent areas are a display and policy projection and are never
authored. `compozy extension validate <dir> -o json` returns `consent_areas`; show that to the user
before proposing an install.

Grant ceilings by install source: dev links (`workspace`), local-path installs (`user`), and bundled
extensions get every declared method. Published installs (`curated`, `github`, `git`) run under the
marketplace tier, limited to `logs.read`, `memory.read`, `observe.read`, `session.read`,
`skills.read`, and `tool.read`; anything outside is dropped at grant time with a recorded diagnostic.
Design a mutating extension as a local or dev-linked install, not a published one.

### Durable session input

An extension that guides a busy session must use the daemon-owned input operations. `sessions/prompt`
accepts `mode` (`queue`, `interrupt`, or `steer`). Both `interrupt` and `steer` require
`expected_turn_id`; its result reports
`status` and `delivery`. Treat those fields as the admission decision. A transcript marker only records
history; it is not an action result.

| Intent                                          | Host API method           | Permission      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Read pending input in dispatch order            | `sessions/inputs/list`    | `session.read`  |
| Replace a queued input and its durable identity | `sessions/inputs/replace` | `session.write` |
| Remove a queued input                           | `sessions/inputs/cancel`  | `session.write` |
| Promote a queued input into steering            | `sessions/inputs/promote` | `session.write` |

Every mutating input operation names `workspace_id`, `session_id`, and `queue_entry_id`. Replace and
promote also require fresh `text`, `message_id`, and `idempotency_key`; promote requires the current
`expected_turn_id`. Read the list again after an action instead of maintaining a private queue or
assuming an input was delivered from its position alone.

### Durable session runtime

Use `sessions/runtime/set` and `sessions/runtime/clear` with `session.write` when an extension must
change next-prompt runtime intent. Both require `workspace_id`, `session_id`, and the current
`expected_revision`; set also requires the complete runtime selection. They return `SessionStatus`,
do not start or reconfigure ACP, and reject a stale revision. Read session status again after a
conflict rather than retrying the old selection.

### Session catalog archive

Use `sessions/archive` and `sessions/unarchive` with `session.write` to control catalog visibility
without deleting history. Only stopped sessions can be archived. `sessions/list` excludes archived
rows by default and accepts `archive` as `exclude`, `only`, or `include`. Archived sessions remain
available through direct read methods, but must be unarchived before a prompt or resume operation.

## Provide Surfaces

Closed set, validated at build, install, and load.

| Provide                 | Extension must implement                                                 | Public |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| `tool.provider`         | `provide_tools`, `tools/call`                                            | yes    |
| `memory.backend`        | `memory/store`, `memory/recall`, `memory/forget`                         | yes    |
| `model.source`          | `models/list`                                                            | yes    |
| `loop.watch_source`     | `watch/poll`                                                             | yes    |
| `view.provider`         | `view/open`, `view/event`, `view/close`                                  | yes    |
| `connectivity.provider` | `connectivity/establish`, `connectivity/status`, `connectivity/teardown` | yes    |
| `forge.provider`        | `forge/capabilities`, `forge/status`, `forge/pr_create`                  | yes    |
| `bridge.adapter`        | `bridges/deliver`, `bridges/targets/snapshot`                            | no     |

Missing a required service method fails the build. `bridge.adapter` is excluded from the public
surface: an installed third-party manifest declaring it is rejected deterministically, because
external bridge authoring is a planned follow-up program. Never scaffold one for a user.

Every `watch/poll` response requires a stable `event_key`. The runtime trims it and normalizes its
Unicode to NFC, one canonical byte form. Invalid UTF-8 and values over 256 bytes are rejected before
a Loop starts. Redelivery of the same source key and event key returns the existing Loop run as a
structured suppression instead of starting duplicate work.

A `connectivity.provider` is global-only and requires a confirmed Live Network participation
digest. Its `channel_scopes` must include `gateway.private`, `gateway.public`, or both; the daemon
refuses a tier outside that declared set before starting provider code. Register all three methods with `ConnectivityProvider` in Go or
`registerConnectivityProvider` in TypeScript. `connectivity/establish` receives the tier, a loopback
forward target, an opaque challenge path, and a deadline; return HTTPS endpoints only after the
route forwards the challenge unchanged. `connectivity/status` reports the same tier's current
health. `connectivity/teardown` must end forwarding within its deadline before returning
`stopped: true`. CompozyOS verifies the challenge itself and advertises nothing on failure. A changed
live registry digest requires fresh consent, and only one provider may be selected per tier.

A `forge.provider` reports which Git remotes it serves, its pull-request vocabulary, availability,
default branch, compare URL template, and PR template paths. Register `forge/capabilities`,
`forge/status`, and `forge/pr_create` together with `ForgeProvider` in Go or `registerForgeProvider`
in TypeScript. Served capabilities name the provider/remote, request noun, open/view labels,
`supports_draft`, optional `{base}`/`{head}` compare template, ordered template paths, and a
credential source of `binding` or `gh` when available. Status returns pull-request identity/state,
merged evidence, and fetch time. Create accepts head/base/title plus optional body/draft and returns
`created` or `opened_existing` with a positive number and absolute URL. Use only
`credential_absent`, `credential_expired`, `rate_limited`, or `unsupported_remote` as safe causes;
never return credential values.

The bundled `tailscale` provider requires the declared `TS_AUTHKEY` binding. Set it
through hidden input with `compozy extension secrets set tailscale --env TS_AUTHKEY`;
never place the value in argv, a manifest, or a prompt.

For a host bridge adapter, `delivery_id` is opaque: acknowledge the exact received value and sequence,
without trimming or reformatting it. Cursor diagnostics identify ownership with a structured
`{kind, workspace_id}` scope, never a joined string; `kind` is closed to `global` or `workspace`,
and `workspace_id` is likewise opaque and byte-exact.

## Contributed Commands

A command is presentation metadata on a tool. Add a `command` block to the tool registration
(`verb`, `summary`, optional `example`, and a `flags` map of CLI flag name to top-level input-schema
field), and declare parent groups with `extension.CommandGroup(path, summary)` /
`extension.commandGroup(path, summary)`.

Build and manifest load both enforce: `/`-joined paths with maximum depth 2; groups non-executable
and never leafless; unique paths per extension; no leaf that is also a group prefix; no group-level
flags; and flag names outside the reserved host set `agent, approval-token, cmd, help, input, json,
o, output, session, workspace`.

Flag projection accepts only scalars (`string`, `boolean`, `integer`, `number`), nullable scalars,
enums of the projected scalar, and arrays whose `items` is one supported scalar (repeatable flag).
Objects, nested arrays, tuples, `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`/`not`, conditional schemas, and unresolvable
`$ref` are rejected at build with an `--input` remediation.

`compozy extension exec <ext> --cmd <path>` performs exactly one
`POST /api/tools/ext__<ext>__<tool>/invoke`, so policy, approvals, risk gates, and
`trusted_workspace` apply unchanged. Agents do not need `exec` — call the tool ID directly.

## Command Palette Contributions

Set `resources.cmd_palette` in the SDK definition to add commands, default shortcut suggestions, and
extension-owned views. IDs are local in source and become `ext.<extension>.<id>` at runtime. Tool
actions may reference only tools from the same extension; declarative views require a read-only
source tool. Invalid contributions fail build, validation, install, or dev reload instead of entering
the live catalog.

For a programmable view, start with `view-provider-ts`, declare `program: true`, and map view IDs to
React components with `registerReactViews` from `@compozy/extension-react`. This registers the
TypeScript-only `view.provider` surface (`view/open`, `view/event`, `view/close`). Add `view/patch`
to `permissions.requires` only when the provider pushes frames between user events. Each attached
client owns an isolated session; handler `AbortSignal`s are canceled when work is superseded or the
session closes. Go builds reject programs with `views[<index>].program: view programs require a
TypeScript extension this release`.

Default shortcuts never override core or operator bindings. A conflict stays dormant and Settings
reports the owner. Enabled unhealthy extensions keep their palette entries visible but unavailable
with the health reason. Use `compozy cmd-palette list|inspect --workspace <workspace> -o json` to
inspect the projected result. Full authoring examples and validation rules:
[Command Palette Contributions](https://compozy.com/docs/extensions/cmd-palette).

## Generated Manifest

What `build` writes, for reading rather than editing: `[extension]` (`name`, `version`,
`description`, `min_compozy_version`, `requires_env`), `[capabilities] provides`,
`[permissions] requires`, `[subprocess]` (`command`, `args`, `env`, `secret_env`,
`health_check_interval`, `shutdown_timeout`), `[resources.tools.<handler>]` (id, handler, backend
kind `extension_host`, canonical `input_schema`/`output_schema`, risk metadata, optional `command`),
`[resources.cmd_palette]`, `[[resources.hooks]]`, `[[resources.command_groups]]`, `[[profiles]]`, and
`[network_participation]`.

Resource-only extensions hand-write only `resources.skills|agents|loops|automation|layouts`.
Resource paths resolve inside the extension root; `{{config_dir}}` is that root and
`{{env:NAME}}` reads the daemon process environment. Hooks, tools, command groups, MCP servers,
dynamic resource publication, bridge metadata, and subprocess behavior require a supported code toolchain.

Every static resource accepts an optional `profile` placement. Omit it for every profile; name a
profile to publish only when that profile exists and the extension is enabled there. An absent named
profile leaves the placement dormant.

`[[profiles]]` declares `name`, optional `color` plus one of `icon` or `emoji`, optional
`[profiles.defaults]` (`agent`, `provider`, `sandbox`), and optional `[[profiles.credentials]]`
(`provider`, `slot`). Install preview reports create versus bind and credential needs. Installation
creates a missing declaration once without activating it; an existing name binds without seeding;
updates never mutate an existing profile; removal leaves the profile and credential requirements.

Install enables kit resources by default. `compozy --profile <profile> extension enable|disable
<name>` changes only that profile. Required environment variables are names in the manifest; bind
them to Vault references through the extension secrets surface, which never returns values or
references. When install or update returns a Network confirmation digest, retry only with that exact
digest.

## Structured Workflows

Every command supports `-o json`. Report the structured field, never prose.

New extension, first success (three operator actions after the daemon is running):

```
compozy extension init hello --template tool-provider-go -o json   -> directory, template, files
compozy extension dev hello -o json                                 -> dev, workspace_id, generation_hash
compozy tool invoke ext__hello__search --workspace . --input '{"query":"x"}' -o json
```

`dev`, `reload`, `logs`, and `remove` infer the workspace from the working directory. `tool invoke`,
`extension list`, and `extension status` default to global scope: pass `--workspace` to reach a
dev-linked instance's tools, and read dev instances through `GET /api/extensions?workspace=<id>` or
an agent caller whose session binds the workspace — a dev-only instance never appears in
`extension list`.

Pre-install review:

```
compozy extension build <dir> -o json      -> generation_hash, generation_dir, manifest_path
compozy extension validate <gen-dir> -o json -> issues[] (path/line/column/field/severity), consent_areas[]
```

Resource-only development uses the same commands. Start from a handwritten native manifest with at
least one `resources.skills|agents|loops|automation|layouts` path; `build`, `dev`, `reload`, and
`dev --watch` publish changes without executing extension code.

Iterate:

```
compozy extension reload <name> <dir> -o json   -> new generation_hash
compozy extension logs <name> -o json           -> stream_epoch, logs[]
compozy extension status <name> -o json         -> published instance: state, health, consecutive_failures, restart_backoff_ms
```

Resume logs with the paired cursor rules in `references/extensions.md#logs-and-watch`; a sequence
without its `stream_epoch` is not a valid cursor.

Publish and consume:

```
compozy extension publish <gen-dir> --repository <owner/name> --tag <tag> -o json
compozy extension install github:<owner>/<name>@<tag> --allow-unverified --yes -o json
compozy extension commands <name> -o json
compozy extension exec <name> --cmd <path> [projected flags] -o json
```

Agent-native equivalents are `compozy__extensions_{init,build,validate,dev,reload,logs,publish}`.
`compozy__extensions_dev` and `compozy__extensions_reload` never build: call
`compozy__extensions_build` first and pass its `generation_hash`.

Stop and report instead of guessing when `validate` returns any `error` severity, when a permission
is rejected as unknown, when a build reports a command-tree or flag-projection failure, or when a
reload reports `activation_failed` (the last-good generation is still serving).
